            <h2> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
                if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s 
                worth.

            <p> " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make 
                a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
                I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly 
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. 
                Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, 
                working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

            <h2>
                Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
            </h2>
            <p> 
                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some 
                structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                    It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ”
